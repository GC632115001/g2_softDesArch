## Problem
1. Failed return result
2. Remote service down
3. Event routing fails
4. Event-handling system down

### Solution for problem 1. Implement proper error handling and provide meaningful error messages to the requestor.
### Solution for problem 2. Use timeouts to limit the waiting time for a response from the remote service.
### Solution for problem 3. Implement event replay mechanisms to handle events that were missed or misrouted. Example, redirect to root "/" or "/error404".
### Solution for problem 4. Monitor the health and performance of the messaging system and implement proper alerting and monitoring.

## Decision Driver
- User experience
- Time to implement
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Reliability

## Problem
1. Maintaining data consistency in distributed systems where atomic execution of all operations in a transaction is challenging.
2. Difficulty in guaranteeing the successful completion or rollback of long-lived transactions involving multiple steps.

### Solution for problem 1. breaking down a complex business transaction into multiple, smaller, independent steps or services.
### Solution for problem 2. Roll back or compensate previous steps if any subsequent step fails.

## Decision Driver
- Data Consistency
- Long-Lived Transactions
- Failure Handling
- Distributed System Complexity

## Problem
1. messages are lost or unordered
2. data integrity is complex
3. unpredictable latency
4. high-bandwidth consumption

### Solution for problem 1. Use message queues or event brokers that provide guaranteed message delivery and ordering.
### Solution for problem 2. Apply event sourcing and use an event store to maintain the complete history of events.
### Solution for problem 3. Implement load balancing, scalability, and distributed processing to manage latency spikes effectively.
### Solution for problem 4. Implement event-driven architectures with intelligent event filtering and routing mechanisms.

## Decision Driver
- risky, complex, costly, and time-consuming
- scale and reliability
- user experience

## Problem
1. the side-effect of loose dependency between the services that use event notifications
2. difficult in managing the overall system state
3. Events modifications and versioning
4. Synchronous flows

### Solution for problem 1. Improve observability and monitoring capabilities by implementing comprehensive logging, tracing, and monitoring mechanisms.
### Solution for problem 2. Using distributed transactional models
### Solution for problem 3. Use automated testing and deployment pipelines to ensure event compatibility across the system.
### Solution for problem 4. Design the system architecture to appropriately handle synchronous flows by identifying critical points

## Problem
1. The coupling is too high
2. Lack of Independence
3. Hard to update

### Solution for problem 1. Introduce a dispatch center or event center that acts as an intermediate between publishers and subscribers
### Solution for problem 2. Don't have to directly interacting with subscribers. Subscribers can independently subscribe to the event center and receive notifications
### Solution for problem 3. Adding new subscribers becomes easier with the publish-subscribe pattern. New subscribers can directly subscribe to the event center without modifying existing code.

## Decision Driver
- Decoupling of components
- extensibility
- code organization

Event driven architecture: the good, the bad, and the ugly

## Problem
1. Event driven architecture is overly complex
2. Security is compromised by event driven architecture
3. Event driven architecture makes debugging more complicated
4. Distributed, highly decoupled services make monitoring a challenge
5. Everything has to be asynchronous
6. Rollback becomes impractical, if not impossible

### Solution for problem 1. implement distributed and decentralized architectures
### Solution for problem 2. producers and consumers of events can be restricted to interact with specific queues, with very clear definitions of which services can write and consume events.
### Solution for problem 3. Can track bug in 2 situations 1. The service didn’t use the data/event it received appropriately -> consumer/customer fault 2. The service didn’t receive the necessary data configured appropriately -> producer of that data fault
### Solution for problem 4. Use standard tools for monitoring of distributed microservices in event driven architectures. For example, you have a range of ‘out of the box’ options with Confluent Cloud.
### Solution for problem 5. A point-to-point flow can still be event driven—creating events, placing them onto message platforms
### Solution for problem 6. implement a SAGA pattern

## Decision Driver
- Demand for real-time
- faster implementation
- reduce complexity and interdependencies

2. Debugging and Troubleshooting Challenges
3. Difficulties with Monitoring

### Solution for problem 1. Utilize established design patterns, such as event sourcing, CQRS, and event-driven integration patterns
### Solution for problem 2. Implement distributed tracing mechanisms to trace events across the entire event-driven system.
### Solution for problem 3. Implement event-driven Monitoring Tools

## Decision Driver
- flexibility and agility
- availability and scalability
- less resource utilization
