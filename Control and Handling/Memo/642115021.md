## Problem
1. The Double Edge of Loosely-Coupled Events
2. Documenting the Anticipation of the Unknown

## Solution for problem
1. Loose coupling is required to achieve scale but must be evaluated carefully to protect or prevent security gaps.
2. Take care to avoid generic names and flags for events their software produces.

## Decision Driver
- Security
- Complexity of creating software

## Problem
1. True decoupling of the producers and consumers as microservices
2. Resiliency of the eventing systems
3. Push-based messaging
4. Single source of truth with a log of immutable events
5. Real-time event streams for data science
6. Accelerated path for machine learning and data science into production environments

## Solution for problem
1. Event-driven architecture enables decoupling of system components, allowing independent scaling, language flexibility, and dynamic addition/removal of event producers and consumers, enhancing system modularity and extensibility.
2. Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling, resiliency, and seamless handling of service failures by storing events and processing them asynchronously, even for offline edge devices.
3. Event-driven architectures eliminate the need for polling by enabling push-based messaging, allowing clients to receive updates in real-time, reducing network I/O and enabling on-the-fly data transformation and analysis.
4. Event-driven ecosystems enable a "single source of truth" by providing an immutable stream of events that represent changes in entities' states, facilitating business data governance, auditing, and the ability to explain data-derived decisions.
5. Event-driven architectures enable real-time decision making by leveraging event streams and in-stream processing, allowing applications to respond dynamically to changing business situations and make data-driven decisions.
6. Event-driven architectures accelerate the deployment of machine learning models by enabling real-time testing, selection, and serving of models based on business criteria, leading to faster iterative development and auditable decision-making.

## Problem
1. Event-driven architecture considerations
2. Client-initiated vs. server-initiated models—challenges and use cases

## Solution for problem
1. Event-driven architectures present engineering challenges in terms of protocol fragmentation and selecting the appropriate subscription model (client-initiated or server-initiated). Protocol options include webhooks, WebSub, WebSockets, MQTT, SSE, and Kafka, requiring careful consideration. Client-initiated models involve consumers connecting and subscribing, while server-initiated models push data to consumers. Each model has its complexities and trade-offs.
2. Client-initiated models are ideal for delivering data to end-user devices, with WebSocket, MQTT, and SSE being popular protocols for this approach. These models simplify the producer's work, as they don't need to maintain state, and clients connect and subscribe to channels for receiving messages. On the other hand, server-initiated models are suitable for scaling data streams and handling complex engineering challenges. Webhooks are commonly used in this model, although streaming protocols like AMQP, Kafka, or ActiveMQ are preferred for large-scale data streaming. Real-life examples include Tennis Australia using a client-initiated model with WebSocket and HubSpot leveraging Ably as a server-initiated message broker for chat data streaming to Amazon Kinesis.

## Decision Driver
- Last-mile delivery to end-user devices
- Reduced complexity for the producer
- Choice of protocols
- Scaling high-throughput data streams
- Responsibility on the producer
- Streaming protocols for scalability
