Event Driven Architecture â€” 5 Pitfalls to Avoid

## problem

1. Write to DB and fire event without atomicity
2. Using Event Sourcing Everywhere
3. No Context Propagation
4. Publishing Events with Large Payloads
5. Not Handling Duplicate Events

## Solution

1. This connector captures all change events in the database and produces them as Kafka events, ensuring data consistency.
2. Utilizing simple CRUD capabilities and publishing database change events (CDC) for downstream uses can reduce complexity and allow for Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
3. By adding identification of the broader request context for all events, it becomes simpler to filter for all events related to the end-user request.
4. Store the payload in an object store and pass a reference (a URL) to the object in the event payload.
5. Unique RevisionId as part of the event ensures that second updates on the same RevisionId will (silently) fail, preventing duplicate event processing.

## problem

1. Discoverability
2. Accidental Coupling
3. Leaky Events, Exposing Too Much Information
4. Favour Implementation Over Behaviour

## Solution

1. Make an effort to document your events, possibly using visual aids, to aid discoverability.
2. Be conscious of who is consuming what events to make informed decisions when making changes to schemas or payloads.
3. Take the time to establish standards for your events, taking into account your domain and bounded context.
4. Limit mental translations between teams by being clear on business intent. EventStorming can be helpful in identifying domains and bounded contexts.

## problem

1. Distributed logic
2. Learning curve
3. Additional middleware
4. Asynchronous execution
5. State redundancy

## Solution

1. Use observability tools to monitor and trace events throughout the system.
2. Provide ongoing education and resources to the team to help them understand the new paradigms and technologies.
3. Carefully evaluate the costs and benefits before incorporating new technologies. Provide the necessary support for your team to learn and manage them effectively.
4. Implement safeguards to handle potential race conditions, such as idempotency, sequence numbers or synchronization mechanisms.
5. Utilize patterns such as Event Sourcing and CQRS to manage state more effectively and reduce redundancy.

## problem

1. Duplicated Events
2. Naming Convention Confusion
3. Lack of Clear Workflow Order
4. Error Handling and Troubleshooting

## Solution

1. Thorough planning and alignment are crucial to prevent duplicated events.
2. Enforcing standard naming conventions and facilitating regular communication among teams can mitigate this issue.
3. Proper calibration and configuration of components in response to specific events can resolve this problem.
4. Implementing a comprehensive set of monitoring tools and practices will give visibility into the event flow, allowing for better error handling and troubleshooting.

## problem

1. Failure to ensure order
2. Non-atomic multiple operations
3. Sending multiple events
4. Non-backwards-compatible changes

## Solution

1. Utilize messaging systems with built-in mechanisms for ordering, such as Apache Kafka or Apache Pulsar, which support shared subscriptions or partitions.
2. Use transactions if supported by your database system to wrap multiple operations within a single transaction. This ensures that either all operations succeed or none of them take effect.
3. Consider a sequential approach where events are chained and processed one after another. This ensures that subsequent events are only sent if the preceding events have been successfully processed.
4. Apply versioning to events to ensure backward compatibility. Introduce new fields or changes in a way that allows both old and new event versions to be processed correctly by consumers.

## problem

1. Over-engineering
2. Inconsistent behavior
3. Error handling and troubleshooting

## Solution

1. Carefully assess your system requirements before adopting EDA to avoid unnecessary complexity and costs. Consider simpler alternatives like API calls if they meet your needs.
2. Implement clear guidelines for handling event updates and duplicates to ensure consistent behavior across the system. Thoroughly test and debug scenarios to identify and address any inconsistencies.
3. Utilize reliable third-party tools for monitoring and debugging event flows. Implement robust error handling mechanisms and invest in comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## problem

1. Aligning topics with business domains
2. Versioning and backwards compatibility
3. Synchronous APIs in an EDA
4. Creating standards for headers and payloads
5. Introducing monitoring, including for business people

## Solution

1. Use Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles to identify bounded contexts and define topic names accordingly.
2. Use schema compatibility modes like Apache Avro's 'forward transitive' compatibility for most updates.
3. Use REST within a bounded context and send necessary business events for frontend/backend integration.
4. Standardize headers to indicate event type, correlation IDs, and other relevant metadata.
5. Express events in business language for better understanding and analysis.
