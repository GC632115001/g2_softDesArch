## Problem
- Magnitude of Change
- Time Rate of Change
- Faulty Standards
- Information Overload
- Resistance

### Solution for problem  
- designing the control system certain as assumptions are made concerning the variables expected to change and the degree of change
- Such time lag in feedback slow downs the adaptive process
- control or due to the properly set standards.
- decide the quantity and type of information that should reach
- a control system must first be ‘sold’ to employees before it is installed.

## Decision Driver
- user experience
- flexibility and agility

## Problem
- Decide what you can skip
- Connect responsibility to authority
- Prioritize notifications, not permissions
- Put everything behind feature flags
- Understand who change control affects

### Solution for problem 
- A modern deploy system making the debug-and-fix process easy
- The responsibility can become a reality 
- software can simply roll back the problematic change
- place them where they make sense and to diligently make 
smart decisions regarding the risk they create.
- isolate the impact of changes

## Decision Driver
- responsibility
- Solving unexpected problems.
- software control

## Problem
- THE GOLDEN HAMMER: an over-reliance on a familiar tool even if the tool isn't suited for a particular task.
- BIG BALLS OF MUD: applications with no apparent structure, design, or architecture.
- LACK OF AUTOMATION
- LACK OF OBSERVABILITY

### Solution for problem 
- need to stay up-to-date on tools, technologies, and best practices
- The best way to avoid a big ball of mud is with a well-defined and modular architecture. 
- Automated tools can respond to changes in demand nearly instantaneously.
- Use LogDNA for collecting and analyzing logs, metrics, and traces.

## Decision Driver
- user experience
- Demand for real-time
- Time to implement
