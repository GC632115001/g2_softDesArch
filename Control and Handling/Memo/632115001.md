## problem

1. how to have a clear understanding of requirements 
2. how to find out which requirements pose significant challenges to the design or project plan.
3. how to deliver value to users and appropriately plan the use of development resources.
4. how to have a source of information that will be use for develop product 

## Solution

1. Have a clear understanding of your requirements
2. Start thinking about each component
3. Divide your architecture into slices
4. Make a Prototype


## Decision Driver

- Performance
- Scalability
- Portability
- Extensibility 
- Compliance

## problem

1. Defining The Problem Incorrectly
2. Not Keeping Up With Technology
3. Not Monitoring The System
4. Not Planning For Maintenance And Evolution

## Solution

- Make and guided framework and make sure to communicate with the people in the team properly.
- Choose an architecture style that allows them to leverage newer and future technologies more easily.
- Make a monitoring system.
- take into account on how the system will be used, consider how the system  will be used by people. planning for these the maintenance and evolotion of software from the beginning.

## Decision Driver

- making less mistakes in software architecture

## problem

1. Unrealistic expectations
2. Misjudging overall costs
3. Failure to define a target audience
4. Delays


## Solution

- Do brainstorm or have meeting often
- Make sure to be flexible and know the price.
- You can make survey, talk with user, make a user journey map.
- Nearly uncontrolable but can be fixed by picking the right person for the right job or get more expericed people to lead.

## problem

1. constant tension from many different angles, and it’s often hard to discern which dimensions of the design should get more weight and which should get less.

## Solution

1. USe the use cases, desired outcomes, and constraints as guide lines.
2. start by asking the future users lots of questions to figure out what dimensions of the project or more important and which are less important.
3. it’s about people, do something that your team can support and work together.


## Decision Driver

1. is it better to make the system highly scalable or make it supports real time processing? 
2. Is it better to adhere to relational database best practices or to make the system more performant?
3. Is it better to use existing technology the company is already standardized on or embrace new technology with performance characteristics that better fit the project?

## problem

1. Software architecture decision-making approache appears to be quite limited in practice. In addition, the practitioners are also facing new challenges as different software development methods suggest different approaches for architecture design. 

## Solution
1. to have a holistic view of software architecture decision-making in the given context,to derive information about the various aspects of architecture decision-making including the process, techniques, and factors that decision-making is based on
2. find out why the current architecture decision-making approach is used by the practitioner
3. addresses the different challenges related to the current decision-making approach, the fourth question
4. targets areas that need to be improved during future research

## problem

1. How do you evaluate and communicate the trade-offs of different architectural choices?

## Solution

1. identifying and analyzing options, comparing and ranking options, and selecting and justifying the option
2. the criteria and metrics should be clear, measurable, and relevant to the problem and stakeholders. 
3. Options should be realistic, feasible, and aligned with the project’s vision and strategy.
4. The comparison and ranking should be objective, transparent, and consistent
5. selection and justification should be clear, concise, and convincing.
