## Problem
1. Security is compromised by event driven architecture
2. Event driven architecture makes debugging more complicated
3. Distributed, highly decoupled services make monitoring a challenge
4. Rollback becomes impractical, if not impossible

### Solution for problem 1. Securely control access and permissions for event producers and consumers, restrict interactions to specific queues, and employ encryption to safeguard data during transmission, balancing security with simplicity.
### Solution for problem 2. Enhance logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities for comprehensive visibility and issue resolution in event driven architectures. Establish clear contracts and schemas between microservices for reliable event handling and data consistency, while leveraging dedicated debugging tools like distributed tracing and event replay for efficient problem identification and resolution.
### Solution for problem 3. Enhance monitoring and observability in event driven architecture with centralized tools, metrics, logs, and distributed tracing. Utilize service meshes and proactive alerting for end-to-end visibility, timely anomaly detection, and automated response to performance issues in distributed services.
### Solution for problem 4. Design a fault-tolerant and resilient event driven architecture by implementing compensating actions, sagas, and idempotent operations. Utilize event sourcing, versioning, and comprehensive testing strategies to ensure data consistency, handle failures, and resolve issues effectively.

## problem
1. It's a fairly large event-driven system. So it's hard to understand what's going on in the system.
2. Managing the overall system state of EDA can be difficult.

### Solution for problem 1. Implement effective monitoring and observability practices in the large event-driven system by utilizing centralized logging, distributed tracing, and metrics collection
### Solution for problem 2. Simplify management of the overall system state in event-driven architecture through the use of stateful event processing, centralized state management frameworks, and well-defined data models for consistent state representation.

## Decision Driver
   - Enhance system understanding, facilitate troubleshooting, and ensure efficient management of the event-driven architecture at scale

## problem
1. Ordered queues
2. Delayed queue
3. Event sourced system & Additional Promise status

### Solution for problem 1. Implement a combination of ordered queues, distributed processing optimizations, and service-level monitoring to mitigate the challenges of managing system state in event-driven architecture, accounting for potential delays and out-of-order messages.
### Solution for problem 2. Implement a delayed queue mechanism that maps dependent events, validates dependencies, and uses a back-off strategy like exponential back-off to manage wait times and retries, ensuring proper sequencing and satisfying event dependencies in a chain-like structure
### Solution for problem 3. Implement an event-sourced system that incorporates an additional promise status. When an event is received with missing dependencies, save it with a promised/pending status and proceed with processing once the dependencies are fulfilled. This approach eliminates the need for extra queues and retries, but requires careful design and management of promise/pending states in the code

## decision driver
   - Address the specific challenges related to ordered queues, delayed queues, and managing system state, with a focus on ensuring proper sequencing, handling dependencies, and simplifying the architecture where possible

Asynchronous event handling

## problem
1. Async void event handler may go unnoticed and uncaught

### Solution for problem
   - A custom synchronization context that takes a custom completed/failed callback
   - Reflection to check for the AsyncStateMachineAttribute to determine if an event handler is truly marked as async
   - The GetInvocationList method to get the entire chain of handlers registered to an event
   - DynamicInvoke to invoke the delegate without the compiler complaining about types

## decision driver
   - Ensure that async void event handlers are properly handled and any exceptions or failures within them are caught and handled appropriately

## problem
1. Data Compatibility Issues
2. Coordinating complex distributed processes among multiple services in a tightly coupled synchronous communication model hinders scalability, agility, and fault tolerance.

### Solution for problem 1. Implement event schema versioning and compatibility mechanisms, including semantic versioning, a schema registry, compatibility checks, schema validation, event transformation, and clear documentation, to address data compatibility issues in event-driven software design
### Solution for problem 2. Event-Driven Choreography enables decentralized decision-making, promotes service autonomy, and simplifies the management of complex distributed processes by allowing services to interact asynchronously through events, eliminating the need for a centralized orchestrator

## decision driver
   - scalability, agility, and fault tolerance in complex distributed systems
